You are a developer for a genomics firm that is moving its infrastructure to AWS. Their environment consists of a three-tier web application, a web tier, an application tier and a relational database tier. They have a separate fleet of virtual machines that are used to access large HPC clusters on the fly. Their lab researches run multiple projects simultaneously and they will need to launch and decommission 1,000's of nodes on-demand while reducing the time required to complete genomic sequencing from weeks to days. In order to stay competitive they need to do this at as low cost as possible, with no long-term contracts. These HPC clusters can run any time day or night and their workloads store information in S3, so the instances can be terminated at any time without any effect on the data. What is the most COST EFFECTIVE EC2 pricing model for their requirements?
